					<p>I am currently a senior at the University of California, Riverside. I study physics and computer science. </p>
					<p>
						I am currently in a research group under Professor Bird that specializes in cosmology and the formation of galaxies. These are studied
						through simulations based on MP-Gadget.
						I am studying under Phoebe Upton Sanderbeck as my advisor.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am interested in both the studies of software engineering and data science. I have a strong background in math, statistics, and computer science.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am part of the Aerospace Systems club at UCR as well as the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (I used to be a chemical engineer). Outside of school I like to play video games, 
						watch movies, and play chess. Other times I'd be working on a new project to keep myself busy.
					</p>
					<p>
						This entire website is currently a work in progress. I will come back to make this place look better after I learn javascript.
