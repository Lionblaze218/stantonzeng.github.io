						<p>I am currently a senior at the University of California, Riverside. I study physics and computer science. </p>
						<p>
							I am currently in a research group under Professor Bird that specializes in cosmology and the formation of galaxies. These are studied
							through simulations based on MP-Gadget.
							I am studying under Phoebe Upton Sanderbeck as my advisor.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am interested in both the studies of software engineering and data science. I have a strong background in math, statistics, and computer science.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am part of the Aerospace Systems club at UCR as well as the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (I used to be a chemical engineer). Outside of school I like to play video games, 
							watch movies, and play chess. Other times I'd be working on a new project to keep myself busy.
						</p>
						<p>
							This entire website is currently a work in progress. I will come back to make this place look better after I learn javascript.
